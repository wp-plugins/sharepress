== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I post to the wall of my Facebook page? =

You need the PRO version. All you have to do is [buy a key](http://aaroncollegeman.com/sharepress?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=post-to-page).

= Why do I need to pay for this essential feature (posting to my Facebook page)? =

SharePress' features are without parallel. Being able to post automatically to your Facebook page is only the beginning. The reposting feature is the one that has the potential to bring the most traffic growth to your site.

Plus, Facebook is a very difficult platform the work with - their motto is, "Move fast and break things." No joke. When you pay for SharePress you are paying for Fat Panda to constantly monitor and maintain this stable connection between your site and the social Web.

= I'm posting to Facebook via Twitter. Isn't that the same thing? =

No. SharePress PRO provides you with the ability to customize message (status update) and the photo that appears on Facebook. Posting via Twitter does not provide this feature.

= When will SharePress support LinkedIn? =

Soon. SharePress 3.0 is nigh.

= When will SharePress support Google+? =

At this time it is not possible to publish to Google+ as Google does not offer a writable API. 

Other services and plugins support writing to Google+, but they do this by storing your Google account username and password, which is *extremely* dangerous.

= I'm having trouble. Where can I get support? =

Documentation for SharePress is available [here](http://aaroncollegeman.com/sharepress/help?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=get-support).

E-mail based tech support is available to PRO customers. All you have to do is [buy a key](http://aaroncollegeman.com/sharepress?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=get-support).

* Fixed: The bug introduced by 2.0.12 - everything was considered RPC because I forgot to treat the constant like a constant...

= 2.0.6 =
* Fixed: For sites that don't use a Page for the front door, the og:url meta was using the first permalink of the first post from the loop. This is wrong, it should be using the siteurl on the home page. This is now fixed.

= 1.0.8 =
* Ron Kochanowski reported a strange problem with brand new posts displaying the message "This post is older than the date on which SharePress was activated." in the editor. I couldn't fix the problem, so I eliminated the "feature." Problem solved.

= 1.0.7 =
* Added "sp" prefix to the Facebook classes, now "spFacebook" and "spSpFacebookApiException" - was creating namespace conflicts with other Facebook plugins (thanks [Ben Gillbanks](http://twitter.com/binarymoon) of [WPVOTE](http://www.wpvote.com))

= 1.0.6 =
* Addressing some inconsistencies in the way the plugin is named, and the way that name is used internally.
