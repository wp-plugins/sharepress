Sharepress is a WordPress plugin that publishes your content to your Facebook Wall. 

== Description ==

Reaching an audience of more than 500,000,000 people, Facebook has become the next
great stage from which to speak to the world. Rest assured: your customers and your
readers are there - past, present, and future. 

But if you're like us, then posting things on Facebook is somewhere at the bottom of your list.
After all, you're creating quality content with WordPress, and who has time to keep
one eye on Facebook all day long? No longer will you have to manually share links to 
your Posts - just click Publish, and let Sharepress do the rest.

This version of Sharepress does only one thing: posts your content on your Facebook
Wall, without the distraction of ever laying eyes on those Facebook blues. *Looking
for more power?* The forthcoming [Sharepress Pro](http://sharepress.fatpandadev.com)
builds on the success of Sharepress Lite with a number of excellent features:

* Share your Posts not only on your personal Wall, but also on any Facebook Page
* Share your Post simultaneously on as many pages as you wish, and configure defaults in advance
* Edit the content of each Share on a Post-by-Post basis, including the Featured Image
* Track Comments and Liks, allowing you to measure the success of your content
* Identify the strongest voices in your community, and build your [Tribe](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/tribal-manageme.html), one relationship at a time

Sharepress Pro will be available in early 2011, but you can [register now](http://sharepress.fatpandadev.com),
and we'll let you know when it's ready.

== Installation ==

1. Get the plugin-in.

1. Extract the plugin into your `wp-content/plugins` folder. This should create within
the plugins folder another folder named `sharepress-lite`. If it does not create this folder,
you must create the folder yourself, and put the plugin files in it. Sharepress will not
work unless it resides in a folder named `sharepress-lite`.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

1. Configure Sharepress. Instructions in the application will help you to create your own Facebook Application (required).
